overview Gundhara is a 2D top-down shooter, similar to Commando, Ikari Warriors and Bloody Wolf. The game has two heroes: Jerry and Jinn. Gameplay is simple and dynamic - the chosen hero shoots various enemies (like soldiers and robots) and rescues hostages in various locations. The heroes have guns, but they can also kick and use special weapons. A big boss awaits at the end of each level.
