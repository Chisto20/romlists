overview Two players. Each player controls his/her spaceship (shaped like the Star Trek Enterprise and Klingon ships) trying to destroy each other's ship. One hit will either partially or completely destroy the others ship. If partially, and space stations are selected you can repair and rearm your ship to go back for revenge. This game is timed so there is no limit on the number of ships you can have.
