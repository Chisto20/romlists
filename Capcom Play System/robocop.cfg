overview RoboCop is a side-scrolling platform shoot 'em up arcade game developed and published by Data East. The player controls RoboCop who advances through various stages that are taken from the 1987 movie. RoboCop was licensed to Data East by UK-based Ocean Software who in turn had obtained the rights straight from Orion Pictures at the script stage.\n\nRoboCop features nine levels of action, with two of the game's nine stages being first-person target shooting ranges, in which players can try to accrue bonus points and earn extra health. Marked crates can be smashed to reveal one of three Weapon power-ups; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser and the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun. The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.
