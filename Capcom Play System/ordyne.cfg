overview Ordyne is a horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game, which was released by Namco in 1988 only in Japan; it runs on Namco System 2 hardware, and was ported to the Japanese PC Engine in 1989 and the North American TurboGrafx-16 in 1990. It also features a cameo from Pac-Man, as the "Stock bomber shot" - and the arcade version was also included in Namco Museum Volume 4 for the Sony PlayStation, along with another of the company's Japan-exclusive games, Genpei Tōma Den (which was renamed to The Genji and Heike Clans in North America). The PCE/TG16 version was released on the Wii's Virtual Console on May 7, 2007 in North America and on August 21, 2007 in Japan; it is officially described by Namco as a "comical action shooter". Miyuki Chan also reappeared in a taco shop in Mach Breakers in 1994.\n\nThe players must take control of the genius scientist Yūichirō Tomari and his Chinese assistant Sunday Chin as they attempt to rescue Tomari's fiancée, Kana Aibara from the evil Dr. Kubota and his army of robotic minions. This game has a total of seven rounds to get through - and a boss must be fought at the end of each one (which will be indicated by a change in music). One hit will kill Yūichirō and Sunday (unless either of them has the "Stock bomber shot", as Pac-Man and the shield he is generating will protect them from death for one non-projectile hit), but they can either earn or buy extra lives. This game also features voice samples (in Japanese).
