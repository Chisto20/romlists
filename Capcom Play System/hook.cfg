overview Hook is a side-scrolling, weapon based beat'em up, based on the movie with the same title. Up to four players control Peter Pan or one from the Lost Boys: Ace, Pockets, Thudbutt or Rufio, fighting against Captain Hook and his pirates. Gameplay is similar to other games, like Golden Axe - the heroes go to the right, and kill enemies with their weapons and magic.
