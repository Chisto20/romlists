overview In 'Monster Mode', you try to get the monster's platform raised to the top so as to crush him. In 'Player Vs. Mode', you try to make your opponent's bottles reach the top while preventing your own from doing so. When you complete bottle lines, some of your opponents bottles will be turned into 'timer bottles'. These cannot be made to disappear until the timer runs out.
