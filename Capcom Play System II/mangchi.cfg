overview Another clone, this one is based on the obscure SNES puzzler Darma Dojo (often transcribed as Daruma Dojo). Blocks haveto be punched out of the screen until three of the same color are assembled in the lower boxes, lest they are brought back into the field from below. Sounds trivial, but the time limit gets brutal fast.
