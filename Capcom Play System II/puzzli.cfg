overview Puzzli is an arcade game developed by Metro Corporation, the makers of GunMaster, PuRiRun (also published by Banpresto), the Bust a Move/Groove series and THE iDOLM@STER. Imagine a Match 3 puzzler taking place in a fishing boat, where the player lines up three or more fish to catch them; catch all the fish to advance but should they hit the bottom of the playing field, the game ends there.
