overview A challenging, vertical scrolling shooter.\n\nOn deep space you must fly the 'Zogram' (your spaceship fighter) and destroy hordes of enemies, while dodge space objects.\n\nDestroy eight 'Mitiohro' around the 'Goke' (the enemy base) for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' (the enemy's fighter). After destroying all the 'Mitiohro', return to the 'Battlestar-asat' base.\n\nThe color of 'Mitiohro' on the picture changes when the gates for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' opens. It is the time to attack!\n\nAs you destroy 'Ahro', 'Mitiohro' becomes to leave the 'Goke's' body, but you cannot destroy those 'Mitiohro' with your laser beam.\n\nYou can get a higher score depending of the precision landing of your spaceship at nearer spot to the center of the 'Battlestar-asat' base.\n\nWhen you score 20,000 points, you can get one more Zogram and at 50,000 points you can get another Zogram.
