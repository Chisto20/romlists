overview Semicom's second pure mini game collection relies on quick and simple challenges in the same vein as Bishi Bashi, borrowing its input scheme of three colored buttons. Seventeen games in four tears wait for their completion, ranging from boring stuff like "find the differing image" or "choose the right exit from the labyrinth", to more inventive tasks where the player evades Gozilla's stomping feet or performs magic tricks in form of button combinations.\n\nThe presentation is nothing to write home about. Everything looks distinctively low budget, especially the narrow color range leaves a rather weird impression.
