overview Created as a parody of Konami's own superb and challenging "Gradius" series of shoot-em-ups, Parodius acquired its own identity and would spawn sequels of its own. It maintained the same intuitive power-up system of "Nemesis" and "Salamander" but adopted a graphical style that was entirely its own; something that becomes evident at the very start of the game when players can chose to pilot either a penguin or an octopus rather than the traditional Gradius ship. Parodius' eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins, as players face such enemies as a sumo-wrestling pig and a half-cat/half-boat creature.
