overview The Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series, originally published as Dragon Ball Z: Sparking! (ドラゴンボールZ Sparking! Doragon Bōru Zetto Supākingu!?) in Japan, is a series of fighting games based on the anime and manga Dragon Ball by Akira Toriyama. Each installment was developed by Spike, while they were published by Bandai in Japan and Atari in all other countries. Bandai's role will now be filled by the merged Namco Bandai Games and Atari's PAL distribution network has been absorbed into Namco Bandai Partners. Namco Bandai also handles developing in North America for future DBZ games beginning in 2010, effectively ending Atari's involvement.[1] The trilogy was followed by Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi, released in 2011.
