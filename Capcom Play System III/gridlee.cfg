overview Gridlee is a game that was never released. It was developed by Videa, Inc. in 1982, on hardware designed by Howard Delman. Videa was eventually acquired by Pizza Time Theater and formed the core of their new Sente Technologies division. The hardware that Gridlee ran on evolved into the Bally/Sente SAC I system, which provided a cartridge-based arcade gaming platform that supported such games as Snake Pit, Stocker, and Hat Trick.
