overview Vendetta is a 1991 side-scrolling beat-'em-up arcade game developed and published by Konami. It is the sequel to the 1989 Konami game Crime Fighters.\n\nThe four men of the game's hero gang, The Cobras, fight through waves of enemies to rescue Kate, The Cobras' fifth member, who was kidnapped by the Dead End Gang. As with most beat-em-ups, the game features primarily side-scrolling action. Player score is based on number of opponents eliminated. The game uses 'punch' and 'kick' buttons rather than 'jump' and 'attack'. Pressing both buttons while walking performs an aerial attack.
